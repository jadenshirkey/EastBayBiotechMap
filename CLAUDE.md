# CLAUDE.md - East Bay Biotech Job Search Project

## Project Overview
The user is compiling a comprehensive list of East Bay biotech employers and systematically searching for relevant job openings. They have a PhD in structural biology/protein engineering from Princeton and are seeking positions in protein science or AI-adjacent scientific roles.

## Current Project State
- **Working Directory**: /mnt/c/Users/shirk/OneDrive - Princeton University/Documents/Adulting/EastBayBiotechMap
- **Current Phase**: Two-part process
  1. Add company addresses for Google Maps import
  2. Search for job postings across all companies
- **Next Actions**:
  1. Complete address searches for all 74 companies
  2. Execute systematic job board searches

## File Structure
```
CURRENT FILES:
- east_bay_biotech_combined_notes.csv (74 companies) - READ-ONLY REFERENCE
  Columns: Company Name, Website, City, Relevance to Profile, Company Stage, Notes, Hiring
  ⚠️ DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY - Create new files for tracking

- east_bay_biotech_with_addresses.csv - WORKING FILE WITH ADDRESSES
  Same as above but with Address column added after City
  This is the file to use for Google Maps import and job search tracking

- ProfessionalSummary.txt - User's background emphasizing:
  * Structural biology expertise
  * Protein engineering
  * X-ray crystallography
  * Computational biology (AlphaFold)

- resumes/ folder containing:
  * Shirkey-Jaden-CV.pdf (most recent - Aug 2024)
  * ShirkeyJaden_Academic CV.pdf
  * ShirkeyJaden_Resume_Bain.pdf

PREVIOUS VERSIONS (for reference only):
- east_bay_biotech_MASTER_berkeley_area_20250918_2226_fixed_names.csv (original)
- east_bay_biotech_cleaned.csv
- east_bay_biotech_googlemaps.csv
- east_bay_biotech_tiered_corrected.csv
```

## CRITICAL FILE HANDLING RULES
⚠️ **DO NOT MODIFY east_bay_biotech_combined_notes.csv** ⚠️
- This file should be READ-ONLY for reference
- Use `east_bay_biotech_with_addresses.csv` as the working file
- Create NEW files for tracking:
  1. `east_bay_biotech_job_boards.csv` - For job board URLs
  2. `east_bay_biotech_final.csv` - Final version with addresses AND Hiring column

## Two-Phase Implementation Strategy

### PHASE A: ADDRESS SEARCH (For Google Maps Import)

#### Step A1: Search for Company Addresses
For each company without an address:
```
WebSearch: "[Company Name]" "[City]" CA address headquarters
```
Look for street address, city, state, ZIP format

#### Step A2: Update Addresses File
Use `update_addresses.py` script to update `east_bay_biotech_with_addresses.csv`

### PHASE B: JOB BOARD SEARCH

#### Step B1: Read Working CSV
```python
# Read the working CSV file with addresses
df = pd.read_csv('east_bay_biotech_with_addresses.csv')
companies = df['Company Name'].tolist()
```

#### Step B2: Search Job Boards (USE WEBSEARCH TOOL)
For EACH company, execute these exact searches using the WebSearch tool:

```
1. WebSearch: site:greenhouse.io "[Company Name]"
2. WebSearch: site:lever.co "[Company Name]"
3. WebSearch: site:myworkdayjobs.com "[Company Name]"
4. WebSearch: site:smartrecruiters.com "[Company Name]"
```

**IMPORTANT**:
- Use WebSearch tool, NOT WebFetch
- Search ONE company at a time
- Record the ACTUAL URL if found (e.g., https://boards.greenhouse.io/ginkgobioworks)
- If no results, record as empty

### Step 3: Create NEW Job Boards Tracker
Create new file: `east_bay_biotech_job_boards.csv`

```csv
Company Name,Greenhouse URL,Lever URL,Workday URL,SmartRecruiters URL,Other URL,Date Checked
10x Genomics,,,,,https://careers.10xgenomics.com,2025-01-18
4D Molecular Therapeutics,https://boards.greenhouse.io/4dmt,,,,2025-01-18
```

### Step 4: Create Final CSV with Hiring Column
```python
# At the END of all searches:
# 1. Copy the original CSV to create final version
df_original = pd.read_csv('east_bay_biotech_combined_notes.csv')
df_final = df_original.copy()

# 2. Update only the Hiring column based on search results
df_final['Hiring'] = hiring_status_list

# 3. Save as NEW file
df_final.to_csv('east_bay_biotech_final.csv', index=False)
```

Hiring column values:
- "Yes" = At least one job board URL found with active postings
- "No" = Job board found but no relevant openings
- "Check" = No standardized job board found, needs manual check
- Leave blank if not yet searched

## Execution Instructions

### Phase 1: Setup (5 minutes)
1. Read east_bay_biotech_combined_notes.csv (READ ONLY)
2. Create NEW empty east_bay_biotech_job_boards.csv with headers
3. Get list of all 74 company names

### Phase 2: Systematic Search (2-3 hours)
```python
# Initialize tracking
job_boards_data = []
hiring_status = []

for company in companies:
    print(f"Searching {company}...")

    # Search each platform
    greenhouse_result = WebSearch(f'site:greenhouse.io "{company}"')
    lever_result = WebSearch(f'site:lever.co "{company}"')
    workday_result = WebSearch(f'site:myworkdayjobs.com "{company}"')
    smartrecruiters_result = WebSearch(f'site:smartrecruiters.com "{company}"')

    # Extract URLs from results
    # Look for patterns like:
    # - boards.greenhouse.io/[companyname]
    # - jobs.lever.co/[companyname]
    # - [company].wd1.myworkdayjobs.com
    # - jobs.smartrecruiters.com/[companyname]

    # Add to job_boards_data list
    # Add to hiring_status list
```

### Phase 3: Save Results (10 minutes)
1. Save job_boards_data to east_bay_biotech_job_boards.csv
2. Copy original CSV and update Hiring column
3. Save as east_bay_biotech_final.csv
4. DO NOT modify east_bay_biotech_combined_notes.csv

## User Background Context
The user (Jaden Shirkey) has:
- PhD in Structural Biology from Princeton University (2025)
- Published in Nature (2025)
- Expertise in:
  * Protein purification and expression (E. coli, insect, mammalian)
  * X-ray crystallography
  * Protein engineering (gain-of-function variants)
  * Computational biology (AlphaFold, custom analysis tools)
  * Challenging proteins (500+ kDa complexes, unstable receptors)
- Industry experience: AstraZeneca, Achaogen (GMP-trained)
- Interest in AI-adjacent roles where scientific expertise adds value (NOT ML development)

## Search Keywords Context
When evaluating if jobs exist (for Hiring column), look for ANY scientific positions including:
- Traditional: Scientist, Research Associate, Protein Engineer, Structural Biologist
- AI-Adjacent: Scientific Advisor, Computational Biology, Data Scientist (biological)
- DO NOT filter by match quality - user will evaluate themselves

## Critical Implementation Notes

1. **File Management**:
   - NEVER edit east_bay_biotech_combined_notes.csv directly
   - Create NEW files for all outputs
   - Final result is east_bay_biotech_final.csv (copy with updates)

2. **Company Name Handling**:
   - Use EXACT company name from CSV in searches
   - For companies with common names, add location (e.g., "Bayer Berkeley")
   - Remove special characters for search but keep original in CSV

3. **URL Extraction**:
   - Look for the ACTUAL job board URL, not just company mention
   - Verify URL leads to active job board (not error page)
   - Record even if no current openings (board exists = valuable)

4. **Error Handling**:
   - If WebSearch returns no results, try without quotes
   - If company has merged/changed names, note in job boards CSV
   - If rate-limited, wait 30 seconds between searches

5. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Print progress every 10 companies
   - Save NEW CSV files incrementally (every 20 companies)
   - Use TodoWrite to track completion
   - DO NOT save over existing files

## Expected Outcomes
1. `east_bay_biotech_job_boards.csv` - NEW file with job board URLs
2. `east_bay_biotech_final.csv` - COPY of original with completed Hiring column
3. `east_bay_biotech_combined_notes.csv` - UNCHANGED original file
4. User can visit URLs directly to evaluate specific positions

## Troubleshooting
- If WebSearch blocked: Use alternative search with "careers [Company Name]"
- If no ATS found: Search "[Company Name] jobs site:linkedin.com" as backup
- If company defunct: Mark as "No - Company Inactive" in Hiring column
- If accidentally editing wrong file: STOP and create new file

## Success Metrics
- All 74 companies searched systematically
- Job board URLs found for estimated 60-70% of companies
- Hiring column completed in NEW final.csv file
- Original combined_notes.csv remains unmodified
- User has actionable list for job applications

## Final Reminder
⚠️ The east_bay_biotech_combined_notes.csv file is the user's working reference.
DO NOT EDIT IT. Create NEW files for all outputs.
