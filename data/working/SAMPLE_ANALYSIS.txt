SAMPLE CONFLICT ANALYSIS - OVERLAPPING COMPANIES
================================================================================

Example 1: 10x Genomics
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
CSV Data:                          TXT Data:
  Name: 10x Genomics               Name: 10X Genomics
  City: Pleasanton                 City: Pleasanton
  Address: 6230 Stoneridge Mall    Address: (empty)
          Road, Pleasanton, CA      
          94588                     
  Website: https://www.            Website: www.10xgenomics.com
          10xgenomics.com           
  Stage: Commercial-Stage           Focus: Genomics Platform
  Notes: Single-cell & spatial      
         genomics tools...          

CONFLICT: Website format (https:// vs plain domain)
RESOLUTION: Keep CSV format (professional, complete)
RECOMMENDATION: Use CSV data - more complete with address and proper URL format

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Example 2: Accelero Biostructures (LOCATION CONFLICT)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
CSV Data:                          TXT Data:
  Name: Accelero Biostructures     Name: Accelero Biostructures
  City: San Francisco              City: San Carlos ⚠️ CONFLICT
  Address: 156 2ND ST,             Address: (empty)
          San Francisco, CA 94105   
  Website: https://accelerobio.com Website: accelerobio.com
  Stage: Tools/Services/CDMO       Focus: High-throughput protein
  Notes: High-throughput X-ray              crystallography
         crystallography...        

CONFLICT: City mismatch - CSV says San Francisco but TXT says San Carlos
ANALYSIS: CSV address has San Francisco zip code (94105) which is valid SF
RECOMMENDATION: Keep CSV location (San Francisco) - address validates it

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Example 3: Actym Therapeutics (ADDRESS MISMATCH)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
CSV Data:                          TXT Data:
  Name: Actym Therapeutics         Name: Actym Therapeutics
  City: Berkeley                   City: Berkeley
  Address: 717 Market St,          Address: (empty)
          San Francisco, CA 94103  
          (CONTRADICTION!)         
  Website: https://www.actym.com   Website: actymthera.com
  Stage: Pre-clinical/Startup      Focus: Microbial immunotherapy
  Notes: Microbial-based...                platform

CONFLICT: City listed as Berkeley but address is in San Francisco
INTERNAL ERROR: CSV has internal inconsistency
RECOMMENDATION: Update city from "Berkeley" to "San Francisco" to match address

================================================================================
KEY DATA QUALITY ISSUES IDENTIFIED
================================================================================

1. ADDRESS COMPLETENESS
   Problem: TXT file has NO street addresses for any company (0/181)
   Impact: Cannot verify locations or provide to users
   Solution: Requires manual research/web scraping post-merge

2. WEBSITE FORMAT INCONSISTENCY
   Problem: CSV uses https://domain.com, TXT uses domain.com
   Impact: Inconsistent user experience, TXT data less professional
   Example: CSV "https://www.10xgenomics.com" vs TXT "www.10xgenomics.com"
   Solution: Standardize all URLs to https:// format during merge

3. LOCATION VALIDATION
   Problem: 3 companies have conflicting city data between CSV and TXT
   Impact: Unclear headquarters location
   Examples:
     - Accelero Biostructures: SF vs San Carlos
     - Addition Therapeutics: Berkeley vs South SF
     - Actym Therapeutics: Berkeley label vs SF address
   Solution: Manual research to verify correct location

4. COMPANY STAGE CLASSIFICATION
   Problem: TXT has no company stage field - only "Focus Area"
   Impact: Cannot categorize 156 new companies by maturity
   Solution: Classify based on focus area descriptions and web research

5. DESCRIPTION DEPTH
   Problem: TXT uses brief "Focus Area" vs CSV's detailed "Notes"
   Impact: Less context for new companies
   Solution: Can be enriched post-merge with additional research

MERGE IMPACT ANALYSIS
================================================================================

POSITIVE IMPACTS:
  ✓ 156 additional companies will expand coverage from 124 to 280 (+126%)

  ✓ Includes emerging startups and AI-driven companies
  ✓ More comprehensive database for investors and researchers
  ✓ Better regional representation beyond traditional biotech hubs

CHALLENGES TO ADDRESS:
  ⚠ All 156 new companies missing street addresses
  ⚠ Website format standardization needed

  ⚠ 3 companies need location verification
  ⚠ Descriptions need enhancement

EFFORT ESTIMATE:
  - Address research: 2-4 hours (automated or manual)
  - Location verification: 30 minutes (3 companies)
  - Website URL standardization: <15 minutes (automated)
  - Company stage classification: 1-2 hours
  - Description enhancement: 2-3 hours (optional)
  - Testing and validation: 1 hour
  
  Total Estimated Effort: 6-11 hours
